# 🧪 UniSim Simulation Practice

Welcome to my UniSim simulation practice repository!
I've been actively learning and applying **process simulation techniques** using **Honeywell UniSim Design** — a tool for modeling chemical processes.

## 📌 Objective

To gain hands-on experience in simulating various unit operations and process systems commonly used in chemical engineering. This, my friend Ashis Sutradhar Nitai's guided training, helps reinforce my understanding of mass and energy balances, separation processes, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Software:** UniSim Design R4 (by Honeywell)
* **System:** Windows 10
* **Modules Practiced:**

  * Flash Seperator
  * Set, Adjust tool
  * Mixer/Splitter
  * Pump/Compressor
  * Distillation Column
  * Reactor (basic setup)
